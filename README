yet_another_simple_bowden
=====

This is yet another Bowden extruder for the Printrbot Simple.  Unlike
the other ones, this is designed for the post-beta build, using a
direct drive extruder.

It's still a WIP and hasn't been properly tested.  In particular,
early revisions of this design had trouble shoving the filament all
the way through the teflon tube.

This is also missing a proper cage for the now-external extruder,
which wants to wiggle around a fair bit as it pushes the filament out,
ruining the evenness of the flow.

The design is very, very loosely designed on rsilvers's conversion:

And is slightly more directly based on owens's version of the same:

TODO:

 * fan mount on the hotend plate
 * foot for the extruder to make it sit still
 * gearing for the extruder, to get smoother prints and more reliable feed
